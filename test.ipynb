      "    - Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
      "all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
      "information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
      "inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to *−∞* ) all values in the input\n",
      "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
      "**3.3** **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks**\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",

      "consider three desiderata.\n",
      "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
      "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
      "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
      "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
      "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
      "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12 ]. Hence we also compare\n",
      "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
      "different layer types.\n",
      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
      "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires *O* ( *n* ) sequential operations. In terms of\n",

      "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
      "[ 38 ] and byte-pair [ 31 ] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
      "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size *r* in\n",
      "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
